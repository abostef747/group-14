                Protestors <b class="highlight">continue to gather outside the</b> Supreme Court in a last-ditch bid to
                convince
                lawmakers to
                listen to
                their plight
                TikTok is set to be banned in the US on 19 January after the Supreme Court denied a last ditch legal bid
                from
                its Chinese owner, ByteDance.

                It found the law banning the social media platform did not violate the first amendment rights of TikTok
                and
                its
                170 million users, as the companies argued.

                But will the decision of the country's highest judicial authority actually stop Americans using it?

                President-elect Donald Trump says, simply, the future of TikTok is up to him.

                And the White House says <i>"given the sheer fact of timing"</i>, the process of implementing the law
                will
                indeed fall
                to Trump, who will
                <a href="www.google.com">sworn in on Monday</a>- the day after the ban comes into effect.

                So what happens next?
